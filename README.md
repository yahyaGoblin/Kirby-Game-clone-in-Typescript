# Kirby like Platformer Game clone in Typescript + Kaboom.js

![game preview](preview.png)

hello, this is a game project that I made in typescript following JSLegend's tutorial on freecodecamp.
I learned about the Kaboom library in javascript.
this was quite an enjoyable experience since I also have a bit of experience making games in Unity using typescript as most of the code was quite similar although the loading the level part had me stuck due to a "SPELLING MISTAKE",
overall this was quite helpful learning experience as I'm learning typescript


## How to run the project?

Assuming you have `node` installed.
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Run locally with `npm run dev`
- Build for production with `npm run build` and a dist folder should appear
