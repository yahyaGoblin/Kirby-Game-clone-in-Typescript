# Kirby like Platformer Game clone in Typescript + Kaboom.js

![game preview](preview.png)

hello, this is a game project that I made in typescript following JSLegend's tutorial on freecodecamp.
I learned about the Kaboom library in JavaScript.
this was quite an enjoyable experience since I also have a bit of experience making games in Unity using typescript as most of the code was quite similar although the loading the level part had me stuck due to a "SPELLING MISTAKE",
overall this was quite helpful learning experience as I'm learning typescript
